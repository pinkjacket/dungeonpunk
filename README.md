# _Treasure Shark_

#### _A roguelike about treasure, and maybe friendship, but mostly treasure._

##### _by Jacket_

_This is a roguelike that I decided to make to learn both Python and some game design, and also because if I put all my old tabletop ideas in one it's way more likely that someone will actually see them someday. It's a work in progress, and right now it's fairly new so I'm still laying down a lot of the groundwork, but I have a whole Trello full of plans for this thing and I plan to keep at it. As I write this I'm in the middle of implementing magic and ranged combat!_

## Setup/Installation

* Currently this game isn't in a super-playable state. Well, you CAN play it but there's only one floor, (it IS randomly generated though) three kinds of enemy (randomly placed!) and three items (you get the idea). You can die but not level up yet. I also haven't yet learned how to export it in a conveniently playable format, since there's not a ton to play.
* That said, if you do want to check out what I've got so far you can clone this repository, open it up in PyCharm, and run engine.py (you may have to install tdl first)
